This is the code of conduct for this project, and I will expound on my decision to not pick the rotten code of conduct that Coursera told me to pick
That code of conduct was against my biblical convictions, among which are these things:
ZERO tolerance of homosexuals, trans, and reprobates.
ZERO compromising.
That is the reason I could not pick that idiotic code of conduct (Contributer Covenant Code of Conduct). Here is my own:
My Pledge: I will not pelagorise or pirate. Neither will I compromise on religious matters or convictions.
My Standards: Want to know my standards? Pick up a Bible off your shelf and read it (yes, I am quoting Mike Johnsen).
My standards regarding software engineering: Code shall be easy to read, no-fluff, and apps shall be standup and straightforward with no intrusive ads.
